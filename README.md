# Lab 4 — Data Preprocessing Techniques

This lab is based on Chapter 4 of *Python Machine Learning * and explores common **data preprocessing techniques** used in machine learning.  
The code is provided in `lab4_preprocessing.py` and is structured into multiple sections.  
Each section demonstrates preprocessing steps, and you are encouraged to record your **observations and answers** in this README.

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
- Identify and handle missing data.
- Encode categorical variables (ordinal, nominal).
- Partition datasets into training and test sets.
- Apply feature scaling techniques (normalization and standardization).
- Select meaningful features using different methods (L1 regularization, SBS, Random Forests).
